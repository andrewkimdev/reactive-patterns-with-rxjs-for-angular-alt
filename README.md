# Reactive Patterns with RxJS for Angular: Updated Source Code

## What is this?
This repository contains the source code associated with the book [Reactive Patterns with RxJS for Angular: A practical guide to managing your Angular application's data reactively and efficiently using RxJS 7](https://www.amazon.com/Reactive-Patterns-RxJS-Angular-applications-ebook/dp/B09T72K5VP). The original source code for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Reactive-Patterns-with-RxJS-for-Angular).

## Why create this?
I made several modifications to the original code to better fit modern development practices and to enhance readability. Here's what changed:

- **Up-to-date Angular version:** Migrated from Angular 12 to Angular 16.
- **Git Branch Organization:** Transitioned from folder-based to git branch-based browsing for easier code navigation.
- **Library Consolidation:** Unified the use of libraries, e.g., using a single version of BootStrap instead of mixing versions 3 and 4.
- **Linting and Cleanup:** Improved code organization in "app.module.ts" by partitioning imported modules, removed unused imports across files.
- **Readability Enhancements:** Made code more readable, e.g., switching from Array.prototype.indexOf() to Array.prototype.includes() for array item search.
- **Refactoring:** Moved verbose methods to separate utility functions for better clarity and maintainability.
